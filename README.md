Data Cleaning
I performed initial data cleaning in MS Excel, ensuring:
Quantity sold was not below 1.
Unit price was not below $0.
Visuals Created in Power BI
Monthly Revenue (2011): A time-series chart showing monthly revenue trends to help the CEO analyze seasonal patterns and forecast future sales.
Top 10 Countries by Revenue (Excluding UK): A bar chart displaying the top 10 revenue-generating countries, excluding the UK, along with quantity sold for the CMO.
Top 10 Customers by Revenue: A descending bar chart showing the highest revenue-generating customers for the CMO to focus on.
Global Product Demand (Excluding UK): A map visual highlighting regions with the greatest product demand, helping the CEO identify potential expansion opportunities.
Tools Used
Power BI for all data visualizations.
MS Excel for cleaning the dataset before analysis.
